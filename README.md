This *will* be a controlerless web server architecture for [Elixir], 
made esp. for single-page web apps, with some ideas inspired by /
stolen from [LiftWeb], [Seaside], [Nitrogen].

It uses [WebAssembly] as a DSL allowing to intermix HTML & Elixir.

Finally you will need this project as a library in your mix deps - 
until this is done it is just a testbed for rapidly changing ideas.
