# Rockside

This *will* be a controlerless web server architecture for [Elixir][1], 
made esp. for single-page web apps, with some ideas inspired by /
stolen from [Seaside][2].

Finally you will need this project as a library in your mix deps - 
until this is done it is just a testbed for rapidly changind ideas.
